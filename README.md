# SSP Vision Pro

This Project is made for UQ Student-Staff Partnership Project: Mixed Reality (MR) Virtual Experiment Platform.
This VisionOS project is designed to explore spatial interaction and 3D visualization on Apple Vision Pro. The project focuses on using native VisionOS frameworks to build a structured, interactive spatial experience rather than a traditional 2D interface, helping civil engineering students in their structural planning. The project aims to build foundational UI Interaction in Vision OS.

The goal of this project is to prototype how users can inspect, manipulate, and understand complex objects or scenes in a fully spatial environment, with an emphasis on clarity, performance, and simplicity.

## Project Scope

- Spatial scene rendering in VisionOS  
- Direct interaction with 3D objects (selection, movement, rotation)  
- Anchoring content in physical space  
- Experimentation with Vision Pro input methods (hands, gestures)

## Tech Stack

- VisionOS  
- Swift  
- RealityKit  
- Xcode (VisionOS SDK) 

## Notes

This project is intended as a prototype and learning reference for VisionOS development. The structure prioritizes readability and iteration over feature completeness.
